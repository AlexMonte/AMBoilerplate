# AMBoilerplate


This is a Boilerplate template I'm designing to increase the productivity of my work as well as increase my skills with Html, CSS/SCSS and Javascript.

## HTML

The HTML aspect of this project is pretty straight forward using static .html files to build a website. might chnage the method for more dynamic content. Baby steps first though!

## CSS/SCSS

Here lies the crux of this project, getting all the element and complimentaty classes is gonna take a lot of work, I'm using inspiration in how [Bootstrap] is set up (I could just use bootstrap itself but I feel that would defeat the purpose on improving my own skills) to better organize my scss files and naming convention.

## Javascript

The hardest part of this project... cause I don't know what to do with it outside of node.js backend stuff... I guess I can get creative with Jquery.


## Todos 
- Set up styles for most common use cases in variables specially to make sure of consistent application througthout elements and classes
- finish 1D (Flex) and 2D (Grid) grid layouts for actual application
